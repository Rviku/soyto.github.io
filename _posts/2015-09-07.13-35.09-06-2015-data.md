## About crawler and updateServerCharacters
This weekend gameforge was updating their webite ( https://en.aion.gameforge.com/website/community/singleplayerranking/ ) with old data, let me explain:

- Sunday 6 of September about 13h CEST they updated their website with data from 5 September
- Monday 7 of September about 12h CEST they updated their website with data from 6 September.

That's weid because i want to make this website up to date as fast i can and seems that Gameforge is awared about this and it's the reason why they aren't updating their website accordly.
